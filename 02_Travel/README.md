# [Travel and Transportation: Moving People and Goods Sustainably](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/climate-change/tree/main/02_Travel)

Transportation accounts for approximately 24% of global CO2 emissions and remains one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases. Yet the climate impact of mobility is not inevitable—it is shaped by physics, infrastructure choices, and individual decisions about how we move. This section examines transportation through a systems lens: energy density, conversion efficiency, mode selection, and the structural differences between fossil-fueled and electric systems.

## The Physics of Movement

Every journey is fundamentally an energy-conversion problem. Vehicles must overcome rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag, and gravity while accelerating mass over distance. The climate impact of this work depends on:

* **Energy carrier** ([fossil fuel](../03_Energy_Sources/03_fossil/) vs. [electricity](02_energy/))
* **Conversion efficiency** ([heat engines vs. electric motors](03_engines/))
* **Load factor** (passengers or cargo per vehicle)
* **Infrastructure** (roads vs. [rails](01_transport/) vs. airways)

Understanding these constraints reveals why some transport modes are intrinsically more climate-efficient than others—and why electrification represents a structural opportunity rather than merely a technology swap.

## In This Section

### [Transportation Modes](01_transport/)

[![Transport modes comparison](01_transport/01_transport.png)](01_transport/)

Compares private and cargo transportation by energy intensity and emissions. Examines rail, buses, cars, and aviation through the lens of per-person and per-ton efficiency. Shows why mode selection often matters more than vehicle efficiency.

---

### [Energy and Batteries](02_energy/)

[![Energy density and storage](02_energy/02_energy.png)](02_energy/)

Explores energy density constraints across fuels and batteries. Explains why fossil fuels dominate long-haul transport despite electrification advantages. Details LFP, NMC, and emerging battery chemistries that power modern electric vehicles.

---

### [Engines: Combustion vs. Electric](03_engines/)

[![Engine systems comparison](03_engines/03_engines.png)](03_engines/)

A systems comparison of internal combustion engines and electric motors. Covers acceleration physics, thermodynamic efficiency, maintenance complexity, material recovery, and long-term climate implications. Demonstrates why electric drivetrains align with decarbonization goals.

---

### [Travel Green, Preserve the Scene](04_scene/)

[![Sustainable travel practices](04_scene/04_scene.png)](04_scene/)

Examines travel through an ecological lens. Connects mobility choices to local ecosystems, resource use, and community resilience. Shows how individual travel decisions—buying local, choosing low-impact transport, respecting natural limits—reduce both emissions and ecological disturbance.

## Key Insights

1. **[Mode matters more than distance](01_transport/)**: A 1,000 km train journey can emit less than a 100 km car trip per passenger
2. **[Electrification](03_engines/) compounds advantages**: Electric systems are more efficient *and* become cleaner as grids decarbonize
3. **[Energy density](02_energy/) is a constraint, not destiny**: Batteries now serve most daily transport needs
4. **Infrastructure shapes choices**: [Rail, tram, and bus](01_transport/) networks enable low-carbon mobility at scale
5. **[Travel behavior has ecological dimensions](04_scene/)**: How we move affects not just climate, but ecosystems and communities

## Current Context (early 2026)

Global transportation emissions continue to rise, driven by expanding [aviation](01_transport/) and freight. However, [electric vehicle](03_engines/) adoption is accelerating, with EVs now representing over 20% of new car sales in major markets. The remaining 1.5°C carbon budget—approximately 170 GtCO2—makes rapid transport decarbonization essential.

The physics of transportation cannot be negotiated. But the choices we make about how to move—individually and collectively—determine whether mobility becomes a climate liability or a solved problem.
