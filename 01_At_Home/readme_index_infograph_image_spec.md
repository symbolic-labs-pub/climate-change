## Purpose

Visualize the system boundaries where individual home-based actions directly affect climate outcomes. Communicate that climate action at home is about aligning behavior with physical and biological systems, not symbolic gestures.

---

## Key Visual Elements

### Central Theme
- A home as a system with inputs, outputs, and internal flows
- Material cycles (waste, water, energy) shown as visible loops
- Connection between household actions and larger systems

### Five Action Domains

1. **Selective Waste Sorting**
   - Separated waste streams: organic, recyclables, residual
   - Material cycles: glass, metal, paper returning to production
   - Organic waste to compost/biogas vs. landfill methane
   - Microplastics as end-state for plastics (irreversible)

2. **Energy Timing**
   - Sun position indicating solar generation peak
   - Appliances (washer, dishwasher) aligned with daylight hours
   - Grid visualization showing renewable vs. fossil backup
   - Clock or timeline showing optimal usage windows

3. **Organic Food**
   - Food cycle: soil > plant > table > compost > soil
   - Haber-Bosch process symbol for synthetic nitrogen
   - Local vs. global supply chain comparison
   - Reduced packaging and transport emissions

4. **Natural Materials**
   - Carbon cycle for wood/paper (grow > use > decay > regrow)
   - Plastic fragmentation path to microplastics
   - Comparison: reversible vs. irreversible material flows
   - Natural fiber examples: cotton, wool, wood, paper

5. **Water Conservation**
   - Water cycle with embedded energy costs at each stage
   - Treatment, pumping, heating, wastewater processing
   - Conservation actions: shorter showers, efficient fixtures
   - Gray water reuse and rainwater collection

## Data Points to Display

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Methane from landfill organics | 25x CO2 warming potential | Waste section |
| Solar peak hours | 10am-4pm typical | Energy timing |
| Haber-Bosch share of emissions | ~1-2% global | Food section |
| Microplastic persistence | 100+ years | Materials section |
| Energy in 1L heated water | ~0.1 kWh | Water section |

## Color Scheme

- **Green:** Organic cycles, natural materials, sustainable actions
- **Blue:** Water systems, clean energy flows
- **Brown/earth tones:** Soil, composting, natural materials
- **Gray:** Plastics, waste, synthetic materials
- **Red/orange:** Fossil inputs, emissions, irreversible flows

---

## Layout

**Recommended structure:** Central home with five surrounding action domains

```
        [Energy Timing]
              |
[Waste] --- [HOME] --- [Materials]
              |
        [Food]   [Water]
```

Or radial design with home at center and five spokes to action areas.

## Style Guidelines

- Systems diagram aesthetic
- Flow arrows showing material and energy movement
- Before/after or comparison elements where helpful
- Avoid moralistic framing; emphasize mechanics
- Consistent with other images in the series
